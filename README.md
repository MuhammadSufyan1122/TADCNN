# TADCNN for Lung cancer classification

Chest CT scan images hold invaluable diagnostic potential in identifying various pulmonary conditions, including malignant tumors. Our project aims to streamline the classification process of these images into four distinct classes: 'adenocarcinoma', 'large cell carcinoma', 'normal', and 'squamous cell carcinoma'.
